# Accenture Data Analytics virtual Intership (Excel + PowerBI)


## Project Overview
As part of the Accenture Data Analyst Virtual Internship (Forage), I worked on a simulated client project for Social Buzz, a rapidly growing social media and content creation platform.
* Client's Problem that Accenture is tasked to address : The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.
* Three requirements that Accenture is tasked to fulfill : Audit of big data practice, recommendations for IPO, analysis of popular content

## Task for Data Analyst
Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

In short, the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.

## Objective
The goal of this project was to identify the Top 5 content categories with the highest popularity for the client, Social Buzz, using real-world business data. Popularity was measured using reaction scores, which represent how users responded to each content item on the platform.

## Process
1. Data Understanding
Started by reviewing the provided data model to decide which datasets were necessary to answer the business question.
2. Cleaned the selected datasets by:
Removing rows with missing or null values
Changing data types where needed
Dropping irrelevant columns not related to the business question
Resulting Cleaned Datasets:
* Reaction Types
* Reactions
* Content
3. Data Modelling
Merged the cleaned datasets to form one final dataset. This allowed for easy analysis and visual storytelling.
Output:
A single cleaned dataset ready for analysis
A list of Top 5 most popular content categories
4. Data Visualization & Storytelling
Created a PowerPoint presentation to visualize the findings using clear, business-friendly charts.
Charts Used:
* Pie Chart – to show category distribution
* Bar Chart – to highlight top categories by reaction score

PowerPoint Presentation – presented final insights


## Insights
1. The Top 5 categories with the highest popularity based on reaction scores are:
Animal ,Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, Food
2. These categories received the highest user engagement across the platform, indicating strong audience interest.
3. Analysis showed that Animal and Science are the most popular categories among users.
4. With Healthy Eating ranking among the highest, it's clear that many users are interested in health-focused content.

## key Learnings
